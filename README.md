# :space_invader: React Native Template TypeScript

> My personal React Native template for a quick start with TypeScript.

## :star: Features

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- Consistent with the default React Native template
- My favorite [dependencies](https://github.com/mthuong/react-native-boilerplate/tree/master/template/README.md)

## :arrow_forward: Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template https://github.com/mthuong/react-native-boilerplate
```

### Usage with older versions of React Native

#### e.g. `react-native@0.63.4`

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template https://github.com/mthuong/react-native-boilerplate/archive/refs/tags/0.63.5.tar.gz
```

See the below table to find out which version of the template to use.

#### React Native <=> Template Version

| React Native  	| Template  	|
|---	            |---	        |
| 0.63.4  	      | 0.63.*      |
